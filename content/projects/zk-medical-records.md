# ZK-Proof Medical Records

A revolutionary approach to medical data privacy that allows patients to prove medical conditions without exposing sensitive information.

## Problem & Solution

Traditional medical records require full disclosure of sensitive data. Our system uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable selective disclosure - patients can prove they have a specific condition without revealing their full medical history.

## Technical Stack

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Custom circuits built with Circom
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity verification contracts on Polygon
- **Frontend**: Next.js with Web3 integration
- **Medical Standards**: HL7 FHIR compliance

This project bridges my medical background with blockchain expertise to solve real-world privacy challenges in healthcare.
