# Calm Focus Timer

A personal project born from frustration with cluttered productivity apps. Built a clean, distraction-free timer that helps maintain deep work sessions.

## Features

- **25-minute Focus Sessions**: Classic Pomodoro technique implementation
- **Ambient Soundscapes**: Nature sounds, white noise, and binaural beats
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual analytics without overwhelming data
- **Offline-First**: PWA that works without internet connection

## Technical Highlights

- React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- IndexedDB for offline data persistence  
- Web Audio API for custom sound mixing
- Service Worker for background notifications

Started as a weekend project, organically grew to 1,000+ active users through word-of-mouth.
