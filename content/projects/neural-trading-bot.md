# Neural Network Trading Bot

Built during ETHGlobal's 48-hour hackathon, this project combines traditional financial analysis with cutting-edge AI to create an autonomous trading system.

## Technical Implementation

The system uses a multi-layered approach:
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-learning algorithm trained on historical market data
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Real-time Twitter and news sentiment processing
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Automated execution on Ethereum mainnet

## Results

- 23% returns over 3-month backtest period
- Sub-second execution times
- Risk-adjusted Sharpe ratio of 2.1

The project won 2nd place in the DeFi track and received recognition for innovative use of machine learning in decentralized finance.
