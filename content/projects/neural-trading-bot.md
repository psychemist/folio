# Neural Trading Bot

An autonomous cryptocurrency trading system that combines deep reinforcement learning with real-time sentiment analysis to make intelligent trading decisions.

## Overview

Built during a 48-hour AI hackathon, this project explores the intersection of machine learning and financial markets. The bot learns optimal trading strategies through reinforcement learning while incorporating market sentiment from social media and news.

## Technical Implementation

### Reinforcement Learning Engine
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** with experience replay
- **Policy Gradient Methods** for continuous action spaces
- Custom reward function balancing profit and risk
- Backtesting on 2 years of historical data

### Sentiment Analysis Pipeline
- Real-time Twitter/Reddit sentiment scraping
- **BERT-based** financial sentiment classifier
- News headline impact scoring
- Multi-source sentiment aggregation

### Market Data Integration
- WebSocket connections to multiple exchanges
- Real-time price feeds and order book analysis
- Technical indicator computation (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- Multi-timeframe analysis
