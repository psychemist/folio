# Building in Public: Why I Share My Failures

Most developers showcase only their successes. But I've found more value in documenting the messy, uncomfortable journey of building software.

## The Failure That Changed Everything

Last year, I spent 3 months building a "revolutionary" productivity app. It had every feature I thought users wanted: AI-powered insights, social sharing, gamification, custom themes.

It failed spectacularly. Zero organic users.

## What I Learned

- **Feature bloat kills focus**: Users wanted one thing done well, not ten things done poorly
- **Building for yourself â‰  building for others**: My assumptions were wrong
- **Perfect launches don't exist**: Shipping imperfect software teaches you more than planning perfect software

## The Power of Public Failure

Sharing this failure led to my most engaged Twitter thread ever. Other developers resonated with the experience. Three people reached out with job opportunities.

Failure, shared openly, creates connection and opportunity.
